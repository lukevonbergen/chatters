# Chatters Internal Product Documentation

This document provides comprehensive internal product documentation for Chatters, designed for onboarding new team members and understanding the complete product functionality.

## Overview

### Product Purpose
Chatters is a React SaaS application for hospitality venue feedback management. The platform enables venues to collect, manage, and act on customer feedback in real-time through QR code-based surveys.

### Target Audience
- **Primary**: Hospitality venues (restaurants, hotels, retail, events)
- **Users**: Venue owners, managers, and staff
- **Geographic**: UK market with GBP pricing

### Architecture Overview
The application serves two distinct domains:
- **Marketing site**: Main domain (getchatters.com)
- **Dashboard app**: Subdomain (my.getchatters.com)

Domain-based routing in `App.js:26` automatically serves appropriate content based on hostname detection.

## Navigation Structure

### Main Navigation Flow
Users enter through different paths based on their role:

1. **Role Detection**: `AppRoutes.js:14-31` automatically detects user role on login
2. **Admin Users**: Redirected to `/admin` (separate routing system)
3. **Regular Users**: Redirected to `/dashboard` with venue context loaded

### Primary Navigation Menu
Located in the top navigation bar (`DashboardFrame.js:203-221`), available on desktop and mobile:

- **Overview** (`/dashboard`) - Main dashboard with daily metrics
- **Feedback** (`/questions`) - Feedback collection and QR code management  
- **Reports** (`/reports`) - Analytics and performance metrics
- **Floor Plan** (`/floorplan`) - Visual table layout and heatmap
- **Staff** (`/staff`) - Team member management

### Secondary Navigation

- **Venue Switcher** - Available for master accounts with multiple venues

### Mobile Navigation

## User Roles & Authentication

### Role Hierarchy
1. **Admin**: Full system access (`admin` role or `@getchatters.com` email)
2. **Master**: Account owners who can manage multiple venues
3. **Manager**: Venue-specific access through staff table relationships

### Authentication Flow (`SignIn.js`)
1. User enters credentials on sign-in page
2. Supabase authentication validates user
3. System creates/verifies user record in `users` table
4. Role detection determines routing destination
5. VenueContext loads appropriate venue access

### Venue Context Resolution (`VenueContext.js`)
- **Master users**: Access venues through `account_id` relationship
- **Manager users**: Access venues through `staff` table membership
- **Admin users**: Never mount VenueContext (bypass venue restrictions)

### Trial System
- Trial banner displays days remaining (`DashboardFrame.js:160-188`)
- Expired trials redirect to billing page automatically
- Trial status tracked in `accounts` table with `trial_ends_at` field

## Special Flows & Edge Cases

### Trial Management
