## üë• Manager Permissions

### How to Enable Manager Access:

**This feature is NOT YET IMPLEMENTED in the UI.** Here's how to enable it manually for now:

### Manual SQL Query:

```sql
-- Allow managers to VIEW Google reviews for a venue
UPDATE venue_permissions
SET can_view_google_reviews = true
WHERE venue_id = 'YOUR_VENUE_ID_HERE';

-- Allow managers to REPLY to Google reviews for a venue
UPDATE venue_permissions
SET can_reply_to_google_reviews = true
WHERE venue_id = 'YOUR_VENUE_ID_HERE';
```

### Future UI Implementation:

You'll want to add a permissions management page where master users can toggle these permissions for managers. This would be in:
- **Settings ‚Üí Staff ‚Üí Managers**
- Or create a new **Settings ‚Üí Permissions** page

---

## üìä Features Overview

### For Master Users:
- ‚úÖ Connect/disconnect Google Business Profile
- ‚úÖ View all Google reviews
- ‚úÖ Reply to reviews
- ‚úÖ Manual sync trigger

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "OAuth error: redirect_uri_mismatch"
**Solution:** Make sure the redirect URI in Google Cloud Console matches exactly:
```
https://my.getchatters.com/api/google/auth-callback
```

### Issue: "No Google Business Profile accounts found"
**Solution:** Make sure the user signing in has a verified Google Business Profile account.

### Issue: "Token refresh failed"
**Solution:** User may need to re-authenticate. Disconnect and reconnect Google.

### Issue: "Permission denied" for managers
**Solution:** Check `venue_permissions` table and ensure `can_view_google_reviews` is `true`.

### Issue: Cron job not running
**Solution:**
1. Check Vercel dashboard ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí Functions
2. Verify `vercel.json` has the cron job configured
3. Check cron job logs in Vercel

## üìà Monitoring

1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Go to **Deployments ‚Üí Functions**

   JOIN google_locations gl ON gl.id = gr.location_id
   WHERE gl.google_connection_id = gc.id) as review_count
FROM google_connections gc

SELECT
  gr.reviewer_name,
  gr.star_rating,
  gr.review_text,
  gr.is_replied,
  gr.review_date,
  gl.location_name,
  v.name as venue_name
