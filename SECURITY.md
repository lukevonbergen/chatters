# Security Documentation - Chatters Platform

## Overview

Chatters is a multi-tenant SaaS platform for hospitality venue feedback management. This document outlines our security architecture, practices, and compliance measures.

## Architecture Security

### Multi-Tenant Data Isolation

**Question: How do you ensure tenant data isolation?**

We implement a hybrid security model:

1. **Database Level**: Row Level Security (RLS) policies ensure only authenticated users can access data
2. **Application Level**: Account-based filtering ensures users only see data from their own account/venues
3. **API Level**: All endpoints validate user permissions and scope data to accessible venues

```sql
-- Example RLS Policy
CREATE POLICY "users_policy" ON users FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = id);
CREATE POLICY "venues_select" ON venues FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);
```

**Data Flow Security:**
- User authentication → JWT token validation → Account ID resolution → Venue access determination → Data scoping

### Authentication & Authorization

**Question: How do you handle user authentication?**

- **Provider**: Supabase Auth (industry-standard authentication service)
- **Method**: JWT tokens with secure session management
- **Password Policy**: Enforced by Supabase (minimum 6 characters, complexity requirements)
- **Session Management**: Automatic token refresh, secure httpOnly cookies
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Available through Supabase Auth providers

**User Roles & Permissions:**
- `admin`: System-wide access (Chatters team only)
- `master`: Account owner, can manage venues and staff within their account
- `manager`: Venue-specific access through staff table relationships

**Question: How do you prevent unauthorized access between accounts?**

1. **Account ID Scoping**: All queries filtered by user's account_id
2. **Staff Table Relationships**: Managers can only access venues they're assigned to
3. **VenueContext Isolation**: Frontend automatically filters available venues per user
4. **API Endpoint Validation**: Server-side verification of venue access rights

## Data Security

### Data Encryption

**Question: How is data encrypted?**

- **At Rest**: PostgreSQL/Supabase encryption at rest (AES-256)
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all API communications
- **Database**: All connections use SSL/TLS encryption
- **Backup**: Encrypted backups via Supabase infrastructure

### Sensitive Data Handling

**Question: How do you handle PII and sensitive data?**

**Customer Feedback Data:**
- No personally identifiable information collected in feedback
- Anonymous feedback collection by design
- Optional email collection with explicit consent

**Staff Data:**
- Names and emails stored for venue management
- No sensitive personal data (SSN, financial info) collected
- GDPR-compliant data retention policies

**Payment Data:**
- Stripe handles all payment processing (PCI DSS compliant)
- No card details stored in our database
- Webhook validation for secure payment notifications

## API Security

### Endpoint Protection

**Question: How are your APIs secured?**

**Authentication Required:**
```javascript
// All dashboard APIs require valid JWT
const { data: { session } } = await supabase.auth.getSession();
headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${session.access_token}` }
```

**Authorization Patterns:**
```javascript
// Admin endpoints verify user role
const userData = await requireMasterRole(req);
if (userData.role !== 'master') {
  throw new Error('Insufficient permissions');
}
```

**Account Scoping:**
```javascript
// All data queries scoped to user's account
.eq('account_id', userData.account_id)
```

### Input Validation & Sanitization

**Question: How do you prevent injection attacks?**

- **SQL Injection**: Parameterized queries via Supabase SDK
- **XSS Prevention**: React's built-in XSS protection + input sanitization
- **CSRF Protection**: SameSite cookies + origin validation
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented via Vercel edge functions

## Infrastructure Security

### Hosting & Deployment

**Question: What's your infrastructure security posture?**

**Platform Security:**
- **Frontend**: Vercel (SOC 2 compliant, DDoS protection)
- **Backend**: Supabase (ISO 27001, SOC 2 Type II certified)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL on AWS with encryption at rest
- **CDN**: Global edge network with automatic HTTPS

**Access Controls:**
- **Environment Variables**: Secure secret management
- **Database Access**: Service role keys with minimal required permissions
- **API Keys**: Rotating keys with environment-specific scoping

### Monitoring & Logging

**Question: How do you monitor for security incidents?**

**Error Tracking:**
- Sentry integration for error monitoring and alerting
- Real-time error notifications for security-related issues

**Access Logging:**
- Supabase audit logs for all database access
- API endpoint logging with user identification
- Failed authentication attempt monitoring

**Performance Monitoring:**
- Vercel Analytics for traffic analysis
- Suspicious activity pattern detection

## Compliance & Privacy

### GDPR Compliance

**Question: Are you GDPR compliant?**

**Data Minimization:**
- Collect only necessary data for service delivery
- Anonymous feedback collection by default
- Explicit consent for email collection

**User Rights:**
- **Right to Access**: Users can export their data via dashboard
- **Right to Deletion**: Account deletion removes all associated data
- **Right to Rectification**: Users can update their information
- **Data Portability**: Export functionality available

**Legal Basis:**
- Legitimate interest for venue feedback collection
- Contract performance for account management
- Consent for marketing communications

### Data Retention

**Question: How long do you retain data?**

- **Active Accounts**: Data retained while account is active
- **Deleted Accounts**: 30-day soft delete, then permanent removal
- **Feedback Data**: Retained for venue analytics, anonymized after 2 years
- **Audit Logs**: 1-year retention for security purposes
