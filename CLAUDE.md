# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

- `npm start` or `npm run dev`: Start development server
- `npm run build`: Build for production
- `npm test`: Run tests

## Project Architecture

This is a React SaaS application for hospitality venue feedback management called "Chatters". The app serves two distinct domains:
- Marketing site: Main domain (getchatters.com)
- Dashboard app: Subdomain (my.getchatters.com)

### Domain-Based Routing

The application uses domain detection in `App.js:26` to serve different content:
- `window.location.hostname.startsWith('my.')` → Dashboard app (`AppRoutes`)
- Other domains → Marketing site (`MarketingRoutes`)

### Authentication & Authorization

The app has three user roles managed through Supabase:
- `admin`: Full system access, bypasses VenueContext
- `master`: Account owners, can access multiple venues
- `manager`: Venue-specific access through staff table

Role detection happens in `AppRoutes.js:14-31` with automatic redirection based on user role.

### State Management

- **VenueContext** (`src/context/VenueContext.js`): Core venue selection and user role management
  - Automatically resolves user's accessible venues based on role
  - Handles venue switching with localStorage persistence
  - **Important**: Admin users should never mount VenueContext (see line 42)
- **ModalContext** (`src/context/ModalContext.js`): Global modal state management

### Key Architecture Patterns

1. **Role-based component rendering**: Many components check `userRole` from VenueContext
2. **Venue-scoped data**: Most API calls are scoped to the current `venueId`
3. **Staff membership resolution**: Managers access venues through the `staff` table relationship
4. **Admin isolation**: Admin users have separate routing and never load venue context

### Database Integration

Uses Supabase with key tables:
- `users`: User authentication and role assignment
- `venues`: Venue information linked to accounts
- `staff`: Many-to-many relationship between users and venues
- `accounts`: Top-level account grouping for venues

### UI Components

- **Tailwind CSS** with custom font configuration (Geist, Gilroy)
- **Radix UI** components for dropdowns, popovers, modals
- **Chart.js** and **Recharts** for data visualization
- **Ant Design** components for some UI elements
- **shadcn/ui** components in `src/components/ui/`

### File Organization

- `src/pages/`: Page components, organized by feature area
- `src/components/`: Reusable components, organized by domain (dashboard, reports, settings, etc.)
- `src/utils/supabase.js`: Supabase client configuration
- `api/`: Serverless functions for Stripe webhooks and admin operations

### Environment Variables

The app requires Supabase configuration:
- `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL`
- `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

### Analytics & Monitoring

- **Sentry** error tracking configured in `App.js:13-18`
- **Vercel Analytics** and **Speed Insights** integrated

## Important Development Notes

- Always check user role before rendering admin-specific features
- Venue switching requires updating localStorage and triggering context refresh
- Admin routes are completely separate from venue-scoped routes
- The `staff` table is the source of truth for manager venue access
