-- Diagnostic query to understand feedback table structure and find question text field

-- 1. Check all columns in feedback table
SELECT
    column_name,
    data_type,
    is_nullable,
    column_default
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'feedback' AND table_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;

-- 2. Get sample feedback records to see what data exists
SELECT * FROM public.feedback
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- 3. Check if there's a questions table that might contain the question text
SELECT
    table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
AND table_name LIKE '%question%';

-- 4. If questions table exists, check its structure
SELECT
    column_name,
    data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'questions' AND table_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;

-- 5. Check for foreign key relationships from feedback to questions
SELECT
    tc.table_name,
    kcu.column_name,
    ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name,
    ccu.column_name AS foreign_column_name
FROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc
JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
    ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
    AND tc.table_schema = kcu.table_schema
JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
    ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
    AND ccu.table_schema = tc.table_schema
WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY'
AND tc.table_name = 'feedback';
