# Frequently Asked Questions

Quick answers to the most common questions.

## Getting Started

### Q: How quickly can I get Chatters running?
**A**: Most customers are collecting feedback within 10-15 minutes of signup. You just need to:
1. Create your venue
2. Add 2-3 questions
3. Download your QR code
4. Print and place it on tables

### Q: Do I need technical skills to set up Chatters?
**A**: No technical skills required! Our interface is designed for restaurant owners and managers. If you can use email or social media, you can use Chatters.

### Q: Can customers leave feedback without downloading an app?
**A**: Yes! Customers simply scan your QR code with their phone's camera app. No downloads required.

## QR Codes & Customer Experience

### Q: What if customers don't know how to scan QR codes?
**A**: Most modern phones (iOS 11+ and Android 8+) scan QR codes automatically with the camera app. For older phones, customers can download any free QR scanner app.

### Q: Can I customize what customers see when they scan the code?
**A**: Yes! You can add your logo, customize colors, and write your own questions. The feedback form will match your brand.

### Q: What happens if a customer accidentally selects the wrong table?
**A**: Staff can see which table the feedback is attributed to. If it's clearly wrong (like feedback about food from the bathroom), staff can note this when resolving.

## Kiosk Mode & Staff Usage

### Q: How do staff access the kiosk mode?
**A**: Staff log in at `my.getchatters.com/kiosk` with their credentials. Managers can set it up on a dedicated tablet or computer for constant monitoring.

### Q: Will staff get overwhelmed with alerts?
**A**: Chatters is designed to be helpful, not overwhelming. You only see:
- Unresolved feedback from the last 2 hours
- Color-coded by urgency (red = urgent, yellow = attention needed)
- Assistance requests (customers who need help now)

### Q: Can multiple staff members use kiosk mode at the same time?
**A**: Yes! Multiple devices can access kiosk mode simultaneously. When one staff member resolves an issue, it disappears for everyone.

## Feedback & Data

### Q: How long is feedback data stored?
**A**: Forever! You can access all historical feedback data. Reports can be generated for any date range since you started using Chatters.

### Q: Can customers leave anonymous feedback?
**A**: Yes, customers don't need to provide any personal information. They only select their table number and answer your questions.

### Q: What if we get negative feedback? How should we handle it?
**A**: Negative feedback is an opportunity! Our system highlights urgent issues so you can:
1. Address the problem immediately while the customer is still there
2. Turn a negative experience into a positive one
3. Prevent the same issue from happening to other customers

## Billing & Plans

### Q: Can I try Chatters before paying?
**A**: Yes! We offer a 14-day free trial with full access to all features. No credit card required to start.

### Q: What happens if I need to cancel?
**A**: You can cancel anytime from your billing settings. There are no cancellation fees, and you can export all your data before canceling.

### Q: Can I upgrade or downgrade my plan?
**A**: Yes! Plan changes take effect immediately. Upgrades are prorated, and downgrades take effect at your next billing cycle.

## Technical Questions

### Q: What if my internet goes down?
**A**: Customers won't be able to submit feedback without internet, but as soon as connection is restored, everything works normally. No data is lost.

### Q: Is my customer data secure?
**A**: Yes! We use bank-level encryption and security measures. Customer feedback is anonymous by default, and all data is securely stored.

### Q: Can Chatters integrate with my POS system?
**A**: We offer API access for custom integrations. Contact our support team to discuss your specific POS system and integration needs.

## Business Usage

### Q: How many feedback responses should I expect?
**A**: Response rates vary by industry and setup, but most customers see 10-20% of their customers leaving feedback. Clear QR code placement and staff encouragement help increase rates.

### Q: Should I respond to every piece of feedback?
**A**: You should address urgent issues (negative feedback) immediately while customers are still there. For positive feedback, a thank you is nice but not required.

### Q: Can I use Chatters for multiple restaurant locations?
**A**: Yes! Our Growth and Enterprise plans support multiple venues. Each location gets its own QR code and feedback tracking.
