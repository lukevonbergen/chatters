# Billing System Fixes - Completed ✅

## Date: 2025-01-01

---

## ✅ CRITICAL ISSUES FIXED

### 1. Database Schema Mismatch (FIXED)

**Problem:** Billing data was being stored on `venues` table but checked on `accounts` table.

**Solution:**
- Modified `api/create-trial-account.js` to:
  1. Create `accounts` record with `trial_ends_at`, `is_paid`
  2. Create `venues` record linked to account via `account_id`
  3. Create `users` record linking auth user to account

**Files Changed:**
- `api/create-trial-account.js` - Now follows correct schema

---

### 2. Webhook Event Handling (FIXED)

**Problem:** Webhook only handled `checkout.session.completed`, ignored cancellations, payment failures, etc.

**Solution:** Implemented handlers for all critical Stripe events:

```javascript
✅ checkout.session.completed  → Upgrade trial to paid
✅ customer.subscription.updated → Handle plan changes
✅ customer.subscription.deleted → Revoke access on cancellation
✅ invoice.payment_failed → Log payment failures
✅ invoice.payment_succeeded → Confirm recurring payments
```

**Impact:**
- Cancelled users will now lose access ✅
- Failed payments will be tracked ✅
- Subscription updates will sync properly ✅
- `stripe_customer_id` and `stripe_subscription_id` now stored ✅

**Files Changed:**
- `api/webhook.js` - Complete rewrite with switch/case for all events

---

### 3. Password Security Vulnerability (FIXED)

**Problem:** Plaintext passwords were being sent to Stripe metadata.

**Solution:**
- Removed password from checkout session metadata
- Webhook now finds users by email lookup instead
- No sensitive data leaves our system

**Files Changed:**
- `api/create-checkout-session.js` - Removed password parameter

---

## ✅ VERIFIED WORKING

### Frontend Already Correct
- ✅ `SignUp.js` - Correctly calls `/api/create-trial-account`
- ✅ `BillingTab.js` - Correctly checks `accounts.is_paid`
- ✅ `Billing.js` - Correctly checks `accounts.is_paid`
- ✅ `ModernDashboardFrame.js` - Correctly enforces trial expiration from accounts table

### No Further Code Changes Needed for Schema
- ✅ No code found checking `venues.is_paid` (searched entire codebase)
- ✅ All trial checks already use `accounts` table

---

## 🚨 URGENT: NEXT STEPS REQUIRED

### Priority 1: Database Migration (CRITICAL)

**You have existing production data that needs migration!**

Any accounts created before this fix will have:
- Billing data on `venues` table (wrong)
- No `accounts` record (missing)
- No `users` record (missing)

**Migration Script Needed:**

```sql
-- 1. Find all venues with billing data (old schema)
SELECT id, email, is_paid, trial_ends_at
FROM venues
WHERE is_paid IS NOT NULL OR trial_ends_at IS NOT NULL;

-- 2. For each old venue, create:
--    a. accounts record
--    b. users record
--    c. Update venue.account_id to link them

-- 3. Move billing data from venues → accounts
```

**Action Required:** Run migration script on production database before deploying code changes.

---

### Priority 2: Stripe Webhook Configuration

**Update Stripe Dashboard to send these events:**

1. Go to Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks
2. Add your webhook endpoint: `https://my.getchatters.com/api/webhook`
3. Subscribe to these events:
   - ✅ `checkout.session.completed`
   - ✅ `customer.subscription.updated`
   - ✅ `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - ✅ `invoice.payment_failed`
   - ✅ `invoice.payment_succeeded`

---

### Priority 3: Implement Customer Portal (HIGH)

**Still Missing:** Users cannot manage their subscriptions.

**Create:** `api/create-portal-session.js`

```javascript
import Stripe from 'stripe';
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY);
const supabase = createClient(/*...*/);

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const { data: user } = await supabase.auth.getUser();

  // Get account's stripe_customer_id
  const { data: userRow } = await supabase
    .from('users')
    .select('account_id')
    .eq('id', user.id)
    .single();

  const { data: account } = await supabase
    .from('accounts')
    .select('stripe_customer_id')
    .eq('id', userRow.account_id)
    .single();

  const session = await stripe.billingPortal.sessions.create({
    customer: account.stripe_customer_id,
    return_url: `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL}/account/billing`,
  });

  res.json({ url: session.url });
}
```

**Then add button in BillingTab:**
```javascript
<button onClick={() => {
  fetch('/api/create-portal-session')
    .then(r => r.json())
    .then(({ url }) => window.location.href = url);
}}>
  Manage Subscription
</button>
```

### Priority 4: Fix Price Display Inconsistency

**Issue:** Two files show different prices.

**Files:**
- `Billing.js` shows £29/mo (OLD - probably unused)
- `BillingTab.js` shows £149/mo (CURRENT)

**Action:**
1. Verify which file is actually used
2. Delete or update the unused one
3. Ensure pricing matches Stripe dashboard

---

### Priority 5: Multi-Venue Billing Clarity

**Question:** How is billing calculated for accounts with multiple venues?

**Current State:**
- Billing is per `account` (not per venue)
- No limit on venue count per account
- Pricing page says "custom pricing based on venues"
- But code allows unlimited venues?

**Action:** Decide on business model:
- Option A: Unlimited venues per account (£149/mo flat)
- Option B: Tiered pricing based on venue count
- Option C: Per-venue pricing

Then implement limits/pricing accordingly.

## 🧪 TESTING CHECKLIST

Before deploying to production, test:

### Trial Flow
- [ ] Sign up with new account
- [ ] Verify `accounts` record created with trial
- [ ] Verify `venues` record linked to account
- [ ] Verify `users` record created with account_id
- [ ] Verify dashboard shows correct trial days remaining
- [ ] Verify trial expiration blocks access correctly

### Payment Flow
- [ ] Start checkout from trial account
- [ ] Complete payment in Stripe test mode
- [ ] Verify webhook receives `checkout.session.completed`
- [ ] Verify `accounts.is_paid` set to `true`
- [ ] Verify `stripe_customer_id` and `stripe_subscription_id` stored
- [ ] Verify immediate dashboard access after payment

### Subscription Management
- [ ] Cancel subscription in Stripe
- [ ] Verify webhook receives `customer.subscription.deleted`
- [ ] Verify `accounts.is_paid` set to `false`
- [ ] Verify dashboard access revoked

### Payment Failure
- [ ] Trigger failed payment in Stripe test mode
- [ ] Verify webhook receives `invoice.payment_failed`
- [ ] Verify logged in console

### Security
- [ ] Verify no passwords in Stripe metadata
- [ ] Verify webhook signature validation works
- [ ] Verify no sensitive data logged

2. `api/webhook.js` - Complete rewrite with multiple event handlers
3. `api/create-checkout-session.js` - Removed password metadata

### Frontend (No Changes Needed)
- `src/pages/auth/SignUp.js` - Already correct ✅

## 🔐 SECURITY IMPROVEMENTS

1. **No More Passwords in Stripe** - Removed password from checkout metadata
2. **Proper Webhook Validation** - Signature verification already in place
3. **No Duplicate Accounts** - Webhook no longer creates duplicate users

---

## 💰 REVENUE IMPACT

**Before:** Paying customers may have been blocked from accessing the system.

**After:** All paid customers will have immediate, uninterrupted access.

**Churn Prevention:** Cancelled subscriptions now properly revoke access, preventing revenue leakage.

---

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT NOTES

1. **DO NOT DEPLOY** without running database migration first
2. Update Stripe webhook configuration to include new events
3. Test thoroughly in staging environment
4. Monitor Stripe webhook logs after deployment
5. Watch Sentry for any errors related to billing
